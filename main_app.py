It also plays a major part in depicting a country‚Äôs culture. Healthy, nutritious, and high-quality food results in not only a better lifestyle but also develops a person‚Äôs immunity and health. Likewise, the consumption of low-quality food which might be deprived of nutritional value impacts a person‚Äôs health negatively and makes them susceptible to all types of diseases. In India, there is a persistent complaint, in any civic body-related food section, about the quality of meals available. Likewise, the quality of the oil is also an important factor while cooking any meal. Therefore, the Quality of oil used in frying the food to affect its taste must be monitored too. Its continuous exposure to relatively high temperatures results in degradation of its quality. The purpose of this study is to build an application for the detection of the quality of food and also to detect repeated frying on cooking oils based on the visual properties of the oils. Classification of food items is done on the basis of time left for consumption, edibility, quality, color, and rancidity. The food items are further classified as stale or usable using artificial intelligence algorithms based on the images acquired through a Cell Phone‚Äôs camera.</h6>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

Similarly, if a cooking oil sample is exposed to heat, or is used in cooking repeatedly, it will become rancid. The second part of our application is the classification of food items based on their freshness and oils based on their rancidity. A classification model is developed for classifying food items into various freshness levels based on their visual properties. For oils, the classification is done on the basis of the visual properties as well as the pH value of the oil sample. The pH value is recorded using a pH sensor integrated with the application. These features are included in our mobile application which is developed using the Flutter toolkit.</h6>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
